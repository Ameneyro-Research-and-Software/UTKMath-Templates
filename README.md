# LaTeX Templates for Math 123 (UTK) Assignments

This work provides LaTeX templates for different assignment types: Exams, Learning Activities. It relies on the LaTeX package [`UTKMathProblems`](https://github.com/Ameneyro-Research-and-Software/UTKMath-Problems 'LaTeX Math Problems Package') which provides some finite math template problems, as well as several commands and environments that aim to help instructors create math problems easily. The templates also use corresponding LaTeX document classes: [`UTKMathExam`](https://github.com/Ameneyro-Research-and-Software/UTKMath-Exam 'LaTeX Math Exam Document Class') for exams, and [`UTKMathLA`](https://github.com/Ameneyro-Research-and-Software/UTKMath-LA 'LaTeX Math Learning Activity Document Class') for learning activity worksheets.

## ExSheets Package

The [`UTKMathProblems`](https://github.com/Ameneyro-Research-and-Software/UTKMath-Problems 'LaTeX Math Problems Package') package contains several commands and environments that can be used to create problems with solutions that can be hidden based on a boolean variable in the preamble, multiple choice questions, rubric items. It also reduces the complexity of code to create mathematical objects like augmented matrices, simplex tableaux, graphs. It also provides some template problems. This package largely builds upon the [ExSheets](https://ctan.org/pkg/exsheets) package by Clemens Niederberger, which facilitates the creation of different variations of an assignment among other things. You can find many usefull features by following the link to the documentation.
